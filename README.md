**`mTADA` jointly analyzes de novo mutations (DNMs) of two traits to 1)
estimate the gene-level genetic overlap of the two traits; 2) report
shared and specific risk genes; and 3) identify additional risk genes
for each analyzed trait.**

### Usage

We describe steps to run `mTADA` in this file: [README_mTADA_DD_EE.md](README_mTADA_DD_EE.md) or [README_mTADA_DD_EE.pdf](README_mTADA_DD_EE.pdf).

### Download data from our analyses for pairs of traits

Analysis results of mTADA can be downloaded from https://hoangtn.shinyapps.io/mtadaresults/.

### Note (a new version of `mTADA`).

A new version of the package will be updated soon. Please [email](mailto:tanhoang.nguyen@vcuhealth.org) us, if there is any issues with the current version.
