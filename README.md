**`mTADA` jointly analyzes de novo mutations (DNMs) of two traits to 1)
estimate the gene-level genetic overlap of the two traits; 2) report
shared and specific risk genes; and 3) identify additional risk genes
for each analyzed trait.**

### Usage

We describe steps to run `mTADA` in this file: [README_mTADA_DD_EE.md](README_mTADA_DD_EE.md) or [README_mTADA_DD_EE.pdf](README_mTADA_DD_EE.pdf).
